            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I enjoy games that I can play with my friends, and do from time to time like me a good story game. They're a great way to relax and challenge myself at the same time. Some of my top games include, Destiny 2, Fortnite, Valorant, and Dead by Daylight.</p>

            <h2>Archery</h2>
            <p>Archery is something I love because it requires patience, focus and consistency. Every small improvement feels rewarding. I did archery competatively for five years through gradeshcool and went to nationals with my team twice. And since then, nothing in the realm of sports has been more fun to me.</p>
